### Chater 7 Service Mesh Observability

- Logs: These are information emitted by software systems in verbose format. 

- Traces: In distributed systems or applications, tracing is the means of finding how a request or an activy was
processd and executed across multiple components.Traces are made up of spans that describe execution/software
processing within a system.


- Metrics: These are numeric measurements of an internval value over a specific period. Metrics are used to aggregate
large volumes of data over an interval of time, which are then used as key perfomance indicators for the system being observed.

Istio generates metric data for latency, erros, traffic, and saturation, which are called four golden signals.
